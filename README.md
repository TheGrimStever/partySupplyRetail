Personal Project from Dev Mountain.

I am building a party supply retail site using Bootstrap for the front end styling
in order to get up and running quickly.  I originally wanted to build the back
end with SQL using Postgres, which is why I used Bootstrap to save styling time,
but ran into a few problems, so I decided to shelve that feature and use MongoDB.

I still plan on working in SQL, but for now I'm going to put the SQL version on
a branch and finish that this summer.

On the SQL branch, the front end is a bit broken as I was in the middle of
connecting the 'Category View' to the back end through the services.  I will fix
that as well.
